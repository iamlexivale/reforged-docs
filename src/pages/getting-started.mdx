# Getting Started

As of right now, the Reforged API only provides a service to you, via the use of a GET request. Responses are available in JSON.

## Schema

The base url for the API is `https://api.reforged.world/`. All data is received via JSON.

## Versioning

We expose different versions of the API, though, some versions may be unavailable at the time you are reading this.

| Version |  Status   |
| :------ | :-------: |
| 1       | Available |

### Request URI

To access version 1 of the api, the base url will be:

```bash
https://api.reforged.world/v1/
```

Unless otherwise specified, unknown requests will return a status 404 error:

```js
{
    "status": 404
}
```

See [Response Codes](https://docs.reforged.world/response-codes) for more information on response and error codes.

## Response Semantics

Each response will have a generic field or set of fields pertaining to the request.

### Response Semantics

```json
{
    // ...
    "request": {
        "timestamp": Number, "version": Number
    }
}
```

| Name      | Type   | Description           |
| :-------- | :----- | :-------------------- |
| timestamp | Number | Time request was made |
| version   | Number | Current Version       |

See [Response Codes](https://docs.reforged.world/response-codes) for more information on error codes and messages.
