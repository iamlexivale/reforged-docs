# Introduction

_Woohoo!!!!_ You found the Official Reforged Public API Documentation. You are the artist and we are the canvas / paints you will use to make creative / useful things for the Reforged community.

The main goal for this reference is to get you started using the Reforged Public API service, and providing the tools which you will need. This guide covers everything from making requests, to understanding responses, to example usage, and much more.

As of now, we only support GET requests to information / routes that are made public by us. The most commonly used APIs are the Network, Player, Town, Nation, and Leaderboard APIs.

## Rate Limit

We use IP based rate-limiting for each of our resources. Our rate-limit is dependent on each resource. View the Rate-Limit section of each resource documentation for further information. _We do not support higher rate-limits._
